                out there about COVID-19 and much of it is false. Below are a

                    dexamethasone</a>

                hospitalized with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation or
                supplemental oxygen. In the absence of published data, it is

                For the majority of those diagnosed with COVID-19, as with the

                those ill enough to require hospitalization remdesivir may speed
                recovery and dexamethasone may reduce the odds of dying. The
                potentially promising therapy of monoclonal antibodies will
                likely be limited in supply for the foreseeable future.

                    83 thousand new COVID-19 cases</a>.
                Additionally, on Oct 22, the 7-day average number of daily
                deaths from COVID-19 in the US was

                    789 and rising</a>.
                As October 2020 draws to a close, by no objective measure is the
                US "rounding the corner" on COVID-19.

                FALSE. While it is reasonable to consider testing following a
                high risk exposure to a known COVID-19 case, completing

                    a 14 day quarantine</a>
                from others is recommended regardless of a test result. It is
                well established that symptoms may develop 2-14 days following
                exposure. A negative test does NOT exclude the possibility one
                may develop symptoms later and spread the disease.
